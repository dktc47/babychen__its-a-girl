## Etymology
Yasmine is a variant of _[Yasmin][1]_, the Persian name for the [jasmine][2] genus of plants which are known for the distinct fragrance of its flowers.
  
[Jasmine tea][3], a combination of white or green tea and jasmine blossoms, is Wendy and Jonathan's go-to pairing with [dim sum][4].
It is also delicious as an alternative in bubble tea recipes or mixed with fruit juice (especially grapefruit or passionfruit).

Just like the English spelling[^1], Yasmine is reminescent of the strong yet sweet scent of the jasmine flower- both characteristics which she hopes to posess.
